        <ul>
            <li class="default-text"> A - any HTML element can act as a selector, for which formatting rules are defined, such as: color, background, size, etc.</li>
            <li class="text2">#id - The identifier defines the unique name of the element, which is used to change its style and refer to it through scripts.</li>
            <li>.class - Classes are used when you need to define a style for one or more elements on a web page. In this case, the elements may be different, but have partially or completely similar design elements. In HTML code, the class name is defined through the class attribute.</li>
            <li>.class1.class2 - You can add several classes to any element at the same time by listing them in the class attribute separated by a space. In this case, the style described in the rules for each class is applied to the element. Since when adding several classes, they can contain the same style properties, but with different values, the value is taken from the class, which is described in the code below.</li>
            <li>* - Sometimes you want to set the same style for all elements of web pages, such as font or text style. In this case, a universal selector that matches the requirements of the web page will help.</li>
